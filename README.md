# Luxury-Housing-Sales-Analysis-Bengaluru
Develop a full-scale real estate analytics pipeline using Python for advanced data cleaning, load the refined dataset into a SQL database, and build a dynamic Power BI dashboard via direct SQL connection. This solution replicates an enterprise-grade workflow for scalable, real-time housing market analysis using a dataset of 100,000+ records.
🏗️ Enterprise-Grade Real Estate Analytics Pipeline
Objective: Design and implement a comprehensive real estate analytics solution that mirrors a production-grade data pipeline used in enterprise environments. The project will leverage a large-scale housing dataset containing over 100,000 records to demonstrate robust data engineering, advanced analytics, and interactive reporting.

Scope of Work:

Advanced Data Cleaning & Preprocessing (Python):

Utilize Python and pandas to perform rigorous data wrangling, including:

Missing value imputation

Outlier detection and treatment

Feature engineering and normalization

Validation of data integrity and consistency

Modularize the workflow for scalability and reproducibility.

Data Storage & Integration (SQL):

Load the cleaned dataset into a structured SQL database (e.g., PostgreSQL or SQL Server).

Design normalized schemas and indexing strategies for efficient querying.

Ensure secure and performant access for downstream analytics tools.

Interactive Dashboard Development (Power BI):

Establish a direct SQL connection in Power BI for real-time data access.

Build a dynamic dashboard showcasing:

Key performance indicators (KPIs)

Regional price trends

Property type distributions

Time-series analysis and forecasting

Apply best practices in visual storytelling and stakeholder-friendly annotation.

Outcome: A fully functional analytics pipeline that demonstrates end-to-end integration — from raw data ingestion and transformation to SQL-based storage and business intelligence visualization. This solution will serve as a blueprint for scalable, enterprise-ready real estate analytics platforms.

Let me know if you'd like help drafting the actual Python scripts, SQL schema, or Power BI layout — we can build this step-by-step.
